Last week, Denis Sinegubko published a very interesting article on the Sucuri blog about &#8220;free&#8221; WordPress premium plugins (link below) and I wanted to share it here, with a few comments from the ThemeAvenue team.

As you know, we sell premium themes and plugins (this article apply to both WordPress themes and plugins). Of course we&#8217;re not particularly happy when one of our products can be downloaded for free. But unlike what you may think, it is not about money.

People who illegally download premium plugins or themes would probably not buy them if they had to. Thus, I do not consider it a loss. The problem is actually much more painful, for us and for you if you use a &#8220;nulled&#8221; product.

There are two reasons why you should never use a &#8220;nulled&#8221; product&#8230;

## 1. Product Support

When you buy a new product, you probably expect to get support from the development team in case something is not working properly. If you don&#8217;t buy the product, you will most likely not get any support. You might have saved a few bucks on the purchase, but you also might end up with something that doesn&#8217;t work.

Now lets say you downloaded a nulled plugin, and it works. What about updates? New bugs are discovered all the time in plugins, and that&#8217;s no big deal, because in most cases, an update will be published to fix the bugs.

Don&#8217;t care about bugs? What about new features?

Most plugins authors regularly add new features to a plugin. If you didn&#8217;t buy the plugin, you probably won&#8217;t get these updates and enjoy the latest options of the plugin.

### &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I don&#8217;t download nulled versions&#8221;

Ok ok. Maybe you personally don&#8217;t use _nulled_ plugins. But did you know you are affected by those who do?

Think about it. You bought a product, hence you have access to the support. However, lots of other users have access to the support too. The more users, the slowest the support. Now, _if_ users who downloaded _nulled_ version also come ask for support, guess who&#8217;s gonna have to wait longer for a reply? Yes, it&#8217;s you.

As you can see, _nulled_ versions are not only bad for developers, they are bad for users who bought the product as well.

## 2. Security Breaches

The above are the best case scenarios. Now let&#8217;s talk about the bad ones&#8230;

As I said in the intro, Denis Sinegubko published a very informative article about <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/unmasking-free-premium-wordpress-plugins.html" target="_blank">Unmasking “Free” Premium WordPress Plugins</a>. I encourage you to read it and see for yourself what _nulled_ plugins can do to your site.

Another example can be see on Sam Parkinson&#8217;s site: <a href="http://samp.im/notes/1154/why-pirating-premium-wordpress-themes-is-a-bad-idea" target="_blank">Why Pirating Premium WordPress Themes is a Bad Idea</a>.

Now you know! Do you still want to try _nulled_ themes or plugins?
