If you&#8217;re visiting Bangkok and need a quality place to work, you should try one of these coworking spaces. Coffee shops can sure be a great place to work, but it&#8217;s harder to find the right place for you (with Internet, ability to charge your laptop, etc).

In you&#8217;re new to SE Asia, be prepared to freeze if you don&#8217;t bring a jacket in these coworking spaces. In most of them, the air conditioner feels like 18-20°C, especially while it&#8217;s 35°C outside. Hubba feels warmer, maybe because the place is smaller and it&#8217;s easier to control temperature.

## Bangkok Coworking Spaces

### Hubba Coworking Space

In my opinion, it&#8217;s simply the best place if you&#8217;re looking to meet other creatives, developers or entrepreneurs. The facilities include a tiny garden that features a big lunch table. This table is great for both lunch and work.

The assistant that welcomes you is helpful. She speaks good English and showed us around.

### Launchpad Coworking Space

They can probably accommodate 200-250 persons for conferences, and the conference equipment is great. It&#8217;s definitely the best place to organize meetups, but what about working there?

While it&#8217;s spacious, clean and comfortable, we didn&#8217;t enjoy working there. We didn&#8217;t like the fact that the few available desks were next to the toilet. Not that it smelled bad, but working 8 hours a day under neon lights makes you feel like a lab rat.

A really cool feature of Launchpad Bangkok is the leisure room. Table tennis, Xbox 360 and PS3 are great ways to forget work issues for an hour&#8230; or more!

### Glowfish Coworking Space

Let&#8217;s put it this way: our worst co-working space experience ever. While I really like the industrial touch and the fact that it&#8217;s well located (not far from Asoke junction), I quickly realized that it wasn&#8217;t well designed. The power plugs are facing your navel, which looks silly. The chairs were so uncomfortable that I wanted to leave this place two hours after I came in.

Nevertheless we worked their all day&#8230;

### Third Place Coworking Space

[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-444" src="https://themeavenue.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/198075_160927977293746_5917386_n-150x150.jpg" alt="198075_160927977293746_5917386_n" width="150" height="150" />][4]

We went there only once, and it was a little while ago. Maybe a year or two. From what I remember, it&#8217;s tiny but well designed. It was freezing cold as usual, but fortunately there&#8217;s a nice rooftop just a few stairs away.

If you&#8217;re looking for a place to work in Bangkok, this is by far the cheapest option, whether you stay for a few days or more than a month. Also, a free drink comes with the daily membership.
