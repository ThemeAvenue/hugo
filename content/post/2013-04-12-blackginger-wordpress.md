We are excited to announce that our first [WordPress theme][1] has just been published on ThemeForest!

About a year ago, we released the <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/black-ginger/2288026?ref=themeavenue" target="_blank">BlackGinger HTML5 Template</a> on ThemeForest. **After a bright succes and a lot of demand for the WordPress version**, we decided to integrate it to our favorite CMS.

However, BlackGinger for WordPress is not just the HTML5 template converted in a WordPress template. It is a complete theme with a lot more options and easy tweaking possibilities&#8230;

## How Does It Work?

As a one page theme, it works quite differently than other WordPress themes. Indeed, it is designed to only display a front page.

We converted the WordPress &#8220;Pages&#8221; functionality into a &#8220;Sections&#8221; functionalities. So, everytime you create a new page, it in facts create a new section on the front page. Of course you can easily re-order the sections thanks to a nice drag-and-drop option.

The theme offers various templates for each section: intro (used to display the slider and testimonials), banner (used to display a call-to-action section), contact (for the contact form and Google Map) and of course a default content template.

## What&#8217;s New in the WordPress version?

Integrating this theme to WordPress meant two things:

  * WordPress offers **more flexibility** and options than a simple HTML template (for non-tech users of course)
  * We had to make the theme **easily customizable** (that&#8217;s the whole point in using WordPress right ;))

Thus, we integrated some new functionalities and we tried to make it as easy to edit as possible. We tested the theme ourselves and with non-tech users in order to spot the difficult parts we had missed. And the result is&#8230;

### Slider & Testimonials Custom Post Types

Adding or removing images from the slider is really easy. You can manage it directly in the WordPress admin, in the &#8220;Slider&#8221; tab. You create a new post, upload your image as featured image and that&#8217;s it! It will automatically appear in the slider.

The slider options are also customizable through the theme admin. A &#8220;Slider&#8221; tab will take you to the main options where you can change the slider speed, controls, pause&#8230;

For the testimonials, same thing. You can add / remove testimonials through a ne tab &#8220;Testimonials&#8221; in the WordPress admin. The testimonials you saved will then be displayed in your intro or anywhere else thanks to a useful shortcode.

### Four Predefined Color Schemes

Colors are the first think you might want to change. **We integrated 4 predefined colors sets** (red, blue, green, orange). However, you can customize the color scheme as you like thanks to 3 colorpickers available in the theme admin. This means our theme provide unlimited color schemes!

### iPhone & Android Placeholders

A mobile app in not only an iPhone app. The HTML version only provided an iPhone placeholder. We changed it in the WordPress version and a **Nexus placeholder is now available for Android apps**! You can easily switch between iPhone and Android with a radio button in the theme admin. It only takes a second.

We didn&#8217;t stop here with placeholders. Indeed, maybe you want to use them in other parts of your site? We kept this in mind. You will find with the theme **4 PSD placeholders**:

  * One iPhone
  * Three iPhones one behind the other
  * One Nexus
  * Three Nexus one behind the other

If you want to use placeholders in your site, just edit the PSD, add your app screenshot in it and save it as an image. You can now upload it anywhere in the site. Isn&#8217;t it simple?

### Shortcodes

What would be a WordPress theme without shortcodes?! This theme comes with a reasonable list of them in order to let you fine-tune your site. You will see al the shortcodes in our demo site with an example for each.
