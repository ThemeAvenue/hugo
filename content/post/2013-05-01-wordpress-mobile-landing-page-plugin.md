This plugin enable anyone with a WordPress site to create beautiful and efficient **mobile landing pages** in minutes! It is easy to use thanks to a clear visual editor, and it optimizes the page performance. Let&#8217;s take a look at the possibilities&#8230;

## Who Needs a Mobile Landing Page?

There are 3 options available if you need a mobile strategy for your business:

  * Responsive design
  * Dedicated website
  * Dedicated landing page

Those 3 options have pros and cons, but one is particularly underestimated: dedicated mobile landing page.

### Solutions for a Mobile Strategy

#### Browsing Context

The first thing to keep in mind is that **desktop and mobile users don&#8217;t need the same information**. If you&#8217;re comfortably seated in front of your 24 inches monitor and have time to spend, then you will enjoy browsing a beautiful website full of informations, testimonials, examples, portfolio, history&#8230;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156" alt="mobile-landing-page" src="https://themeavenue.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mobile-landing-page.png" width="647" height="380" srcset="http://themeavenue.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mobile-landing-page.png 647w, http://themeavenue.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mobile-landing-page-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" />

On the other hand, when you are in the street, browsing from your mobile, your needs are completely different. **You need to access specific information fast**. You don&#8217;t really care about the site being beautiful anymore. What you care about is accessibility and finding the right information because you need it NOW, you can&#8217;t wait.

#### Adapted Mobile Support

**Responsive design** matches the &#8220;home mobile user&#8217;s&#8221; expectations. The site&#8217;s content is the same as the desktop version, which is **not suitable for mobile browsing &#8220;on-the-go&#8221;**. However, to someone using its mobile as a second computer when in his couch, you will convey a nice and professional image. Indeed, responsive design is mostly about&#8230; design! There is no real marketing approach.

Also, on a technical level, responsive design is the most complex technique. It has to be well prepared and planned before the development starts. If you think about converting your site to a responsive one&#8230; Then good luck. On a performance level, a responsive site will be quite slow as it loads some (or all) of the desktop resources, even if they are not displayed.

**A dedicated website** is a great solution to provide relevant content. There is a real marketing approach in this technique: you figure out which information is crucial to your mobile visitors and package it in a lighter version of your desktop site. The visitor will be able to **browse your site easily** while walking to his dinner or in the taxi.

On a technical level there is nothing complicated. However, you will have to manage and update 2 different websites. It takes time and resources. On the performance level, a dedicated site should be much faster than a responsive one, and that will make a big difference.

**Mobile landing page** is the last solution, and the **most efficient in many cases**. It is totally conversion oriented: you want to create leads with your mobile landing page. This approach takes the 2 main factors in consideration: the right information, fast browsing. The mobile landing page will provide the user only the most critical information and use calls-to-action to **convert the visitor immediately into a lead**. By using native phone features, you will enable the visitor to call you or e-mail you in just one click.

This solution is light and extremely fast to load, even with 3G. As you may know, the access time is #1 factor in mobile browsing. Also, the content can be very easy to manage&#8230;

## What Can You Do With This Plugin?

Our **WordPress mobile landing page plugin** is based on the 3rd solution we talked about here above. You install the plugin in your current WordPress site and it is ready to use. First advantage here: you will manage your landing page&#8217;s content directly from your main WordPress site&#8217;s dashboard.

The plugin is very simple. Its interface is composed of 2 parts:

  * the style options (to brand it as you like, with your colors, logo&#8230;)
  * the visual editor.

The visual editor is contained inside a smartphone placeholder: you will have an immediate preview of what your changes will look like on a mobile.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153" alt="wp-mobile-splash-page-editor-700x520" src="https://themeavenue.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wp-mobile-splash-page-editor-700x520.png" width="700" height="520" srcset="http://themeavenue.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wp-mobile-splash-page-editor-700x520.png 700w, http://themeavenue.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wp-mobile-splash-page-editor-700x520-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />

Edit items by a simple click, reorder buttons with drag & drop, edit texts directly inside the editor&#8230; We made it very simple.

On the visitor&#8217;s side, browsing your page will be smooth and straight to the point. We optimized the page so that is **loads extremely fast**. No useless scripts and images will slow down the site. Once loaded, the visitor will access the minimum information, and he will be able to immediately contact you. Three button types are available, all triggering native phone features:

  * Link button: triggers the browser
  * Phone button: triggers the phone with phone number already dialed
  * SMS button: triggers the messaging app
