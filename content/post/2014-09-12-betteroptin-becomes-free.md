Last July we released a new plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/betteroptin/" target="_blank">BetterOptin</a> on CodeCanyon. This plugin allows you to easily create opt-in popups through a visual builder. Its particularity is that it&#8217;s based on a behavior called &#8220;exit-intent&#8221;, which means that the popups will only trigger when your visitors are about to leave the site.

For a number of reasons, we decided to distribute this plugin for free on the WordPress plugins repository and remove it entirely from CodeCanyon.

The main reason why we took this decision is that we wanted to try a new sales channel. While the core plugin will be available for free, we will be selling premium addons on <a href="http://betteropt.in" target="_blank">the plugin&#8217;s official site</a>. It is the first time we try this model and we are very excited about it.

We are also thrilled about giving more back to the community. We put a lot of efforts in developing this plugin. We spend a lot of time testing it (thanks to those who helped during the beta test). This is a product we are proud of and we hope WordPress users will appreciate the free version.

## What About CodeCanyon Buyers?

With this new distribution model and version 1.2.0, we will stop supporting the previous versions sold on CodeCanyon. The big difference between v1.2.0 and earlier versions is the MailChimp compatibility: it is now sold as a premium addon and not built in the core anymore.

If you did buy BetterOptin on CodeCanyon before version 1.2.0, we encourage you to update the plugin with the latest version. Regarding the MailChimp compatibility, **we will give you a free license of the MailChimp addon** in exchange for your CodeCanyon license.

**This offer will be running until October 31st 2014 only.**

To get your free license of the MailChimp addon, please submit a support ticket on <a href="http://support.themeavenue.net/" target="_blank">our support site</a> and ask for your free license.

If you don&#8217;t know how to find your CodeCanyon license you can check out our video: <a href="http://support.themeavenue.net/faqs/get-envato-purchase-code/" target="_blank">http://support.themeavenue.net/faqs/get-envato-purchase-code/</a>
